Problem 1_4:
Write a function 'problem1_4(miles)' to convert miles to feet. There are
5280 feet in each mile. Make the print out a statement as follows:
"There are 10560 feet in 2 miles."  Except for the numbers this state should
be exactly as written.
Tip: Watch the spacing before and after your numbers.  Just one space or the
auto-grader may not give you credit.
